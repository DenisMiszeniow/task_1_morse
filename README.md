# SETTINGS FOR TYPING OF MORSE:

SHORT PUSH TO SPACE - dot (.) (less then 100ms)

LONGER PUSH TO SPACE - dash (-) (from 100ms to 1000 ms)

THE LONGEST PUSH TO SPACE - Space between letters (more then 1000 ms)

SIX TIME DOT (......) - Space between words


# TASK MORSE DECODER:

Napisz aplikacje w React.js pozwalającą na tworzenie wiadomości za pomocą alfabetu morsa za pomocą jednego przycisku. 
Przycisk można wcisnąć krótko lub długo (klawiaturą (SPACJA) KeyUp/Down lub zdarzenia myszki od wciśnięcia do puszczenia ). 
Poza przyciskiem aplikacja powinna wyświetlać wiadomość za pomocą liter odszyfrowanych z kodu morsa w polu pod przyciskiem.
Aplikacja nie musi rozpoznawać wszystkich liter, wystarczy kilka np. S, O, S, (ale mile widziana będzie obsługa wszystkich liter). 




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
